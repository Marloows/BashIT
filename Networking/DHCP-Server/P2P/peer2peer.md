# Peer-To-Peer Connection

Connecting two computers over an ethernet cable to create a simple network won't work as one expects.

Trust me, I've tried!

This project aims to solve this problem by making one of the computers act like a DHCP-Server so that when an ethernet connection is detected, the "server " will assign the other device automatically an IP address.
